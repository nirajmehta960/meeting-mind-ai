Attendees: Sarah (Product Manager), Mike (Tech Lead), Emma (Designer), John (Developer), Lisa (QA)

Sarah: Alright team, let's kick off our sprint planning. We have two weeks to deliver the new user dashboard feature. Mike, can you give us an update on the technical feasibility?

Mike: Yeah, I've reviewed the requirements. The core functionality is doable, but we'll need to integrate with the new API that's still in development. I'd estimate about 8-10 story points for the backend work.

Emma: From a design perspective, I've got the mockups ready. The main challenge will be the responsive layout for mobile devices. I think we can reuse a lot of components from the settings page.

John: I can start on the frontend integration. Should I wait for the API to be ready, or can we build with mock data first?

Sarah: Good question. Let's build with mock data for now. Mike, when do you think the API will be ready?

Mike: Probably by Wednesday next week. We can switch over then.

Sarah: Perfect. Lisa, what's your testing plan?

Lisa: I'll need the test cases by Monday. I'm thinking we should add automated tests for the dashboard loading and data refresh functionality.

Sarah: Great. Let's also make sure we have proper error handling. John, can you add error states for API failures?

John: Yeah, I'll add toast notifications and a retry mechanism.

Sarah: Excellent. So action items: Mike will start on the API integration, John will begin frontend work with mocks, Emma will finalize the mobile designs, and Lisa will prepare test cases. Let's aim for a demo by next Friday. Any blockers?

Mike: None from my side.

Emma: I should have the mobile designs done by Tuesday.

John: Same, I can start today.

Lisa: I'll need the requirements document updated with the new error handling flows.

Sarah: I'll send that over by end of day. Alright team, let's make this sprint count!`;
